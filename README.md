# Console-Based GitHub Simulation

This project is a basic simulation of GitHub functionalities implemented in a console-based C++ application. It includes features such as displaying a loading page, interacting with user input, and simulating GitHub-like actions.

## Features
- **Loading Page:** Displays a loading animation while simulating GitHub-like activities.
- **Interactive:** Waits for user input to proceed, mimicking user interactions in a console environment.
- **Simple Design:** Uses basic C++ and console commands for a straightforward implementation.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Osamakhan95/GitHub-Simulation-Using-Cplusplus
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd github-simulation
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the code using your C++ compiler.
   - Run the executable to see the GitHub simulation in action.

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
   - The program will display a loading page with simulated GitHub actions.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions or prompts to interact with the simulation.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
